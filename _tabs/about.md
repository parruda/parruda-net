Hey there! I'm a developer who's been writing code since I was 9 years old, when I first got my hands on a TK85 and learned BASIC. That early spark turned into a career that's spanned over two decades in tech.

I'm currently part of the Engineering team at Shopify, where I work on the Augmented Engineering Team building AI tools to boost developer productivity. It's the perfect intersection of my passions: Ruby, Rails, and AI.

My journey through tech has been anything but linear. Starting as a webmaster in 2001, I've worn many hats – infrastructure engineer, cloud engineer, DevOps – but through it all, I've always been writing code. As the cloud evolved and infrastructure became code, I found my home in Ruby development, where I've been crafting solutions ever since.

I'm proudly self-taught, which gives me a unique perspective on learning and problem-solving. Some of my notable projects include building FaastRuby, [Burrow.io](https://burrow.io) and most recently [Claude Swarm](https://github.com/parruda/claude-swarm). Currently, I'm contributing to the open source project [Roast](https://github.com/Shopify/roast).

When I'm not coding, you'll find me on the soccer field, snowboarding down a mountain, or possibly jamming to some Foo Fighters (fun fact: I played in a Foo Fighters cover band for 8 years!). 

This blog is where I share my experiences at the intersection of Ruby, Rails, and AI – exploring how these technologies can work together to build amazing things. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

Let's build something great together!
